  <h2 align="center" class="item-header">Description</h2>
  <p class="item-short-description">The SpaceX Starship system is a proposed fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit super heavy-lift launch vehicle under
  development by SpaceX. The system is composed of a booster stage, named Super Heavy, and a second stage, also referred
  to as "Starship". The second stage is being designed as a long-duration cargo, and eventually, passenger-carrying
  spacecraft. The spacecraft will serve as both the second stage and the in-space long-duration orbital spaceship
  </p>
  <h2 align="center" class="item-header">Specs</h2>
  <h3 class="item-description">Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle. SpaceX intends to eventually replace its existing
  Falcon 9 and SpaceX Dragon 2 fleet with Starship, which is expected to take cargo to orbit at far lower cost than any
  other existing launch vehicle</h3>
  <ul class="rocket">
    <li class="list-rocket">Starship is designed with the ability to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and retropropulsively land on a designated landing
    pad. Landing reliability is projected by SpaceX to ultimately be able to achieve "airline levels" of safety due to
    engine-out capability. The spacecraft is also designed to be able to perform automatic rendezvous and docking
    operations, and perform on-orbit propellant transfers between Starships.</li>
    <li class="list-rocket">Starship is also designed with the goal to reach other planets and moons in the solar system after on-orbit propellant
    loading. While retropropulsion is intended to be used for the final landing maneuver on the Earth, Moon, or Mars, 99.9%
    of the energy dissipation on Earth reentry is to be removed aerodynamically, and on Mars, 99% aerodynamically even using
    the much thinner Martian atmosphere, where "body flaps"are used to control attitude during descent and
    optimize both trajectory and energy dissipation during descent</li>
