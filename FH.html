<p class="item-short-description">Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived from
the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional Falcon
9-like first stages as strap-on boosters.Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational
launch vehicle, and the third-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V and Energia.</p>
<h2 align = "center" class="item-header">Specs</h2>
<h3 class="item-description">Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.</h3>
<ul class="rocket">
  <li class="list-rocket"> With the ability to lift into
  orbit nearly <b>64 metric tons</b> (141,000 lb) Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest
  operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy.</li>
  <li class="list-rocket">Falcon Heavy is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose <i>27 Merlin</i>
  engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.</li>
