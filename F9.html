  <h2 align="center">Description</h2>
  <p>Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX in
  the United States. Both the first and second stages are powered by SpaceX Merlin engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen
  and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional Star Wars spacecraft, the
  Millennium Falcon, and the nine Merlin engines of the rocket's first stage.The rocket evolved with versions
  v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016), v1.2 "Full Thrust" (2015–present), including the Block 5 Full Thrust variant, flying
  since May 2018. Unlike most rockets in service, which are expendable launch systems, since the introduction of the Full
  Thrust version, Falcon 9 is partially reusable, with the first stage capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing
  vertically after separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved for the first time on flight 20 in December
  2015.

  <h3>Falcon 9 is the first reusable rocket ever.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In late 2011, SpaceX announced a change in the approach, eliminating the parachutes and going with a
    propulsively-powered-descent approach.Included was a video said to be an approximation depicting the
    first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage, with heat shield, reentering head first
    before rotating for a powered descent.The design was complete on the system for "bringing the rocket back to
    launchpad using only thrusters" by February 2012</li>
    <li>In November 2018, SpaceX announced work on a heavily modified Falcon 9 second stage that would be used for atmospheric
    reentry testing of a number of technologies needed for the full-scale Starship, including an ultra-light heat shield and
    high-Mach control surfaces. Musk indicated it would be "upgraded to be like a mini-BFR ship" but that the stage would
    not be used for landing tests, as the company already believes it has a good handle on propulsive landings. In November
    2018, the first test flight of the modified stage was planned to be no earlier than mid-2019.In the event, the
    design work did not proceed all the way to flight testing, and no reentry tests were done using a returning Falcon 9
    second stage. All SpaceX second stage design/development work for atmospheric reentry moved to the two Starship orbital
    prototype vehicles</li>
